# Devfile Python Hello World

A simple Python application used to demonstrate Devfile command execution.

This repository is designed to showcase all practical patterns supported by
`devfile.yaml` commands, including:

- Logical command chaining (`&&`)
- Shell-style multiline commands
- Pipes (`|`), semicolons (`;`), and OR operators (`||`)
- Windows-style backslash normalization (`\\`)
- Composite commands (sequential, parallel, nested)
