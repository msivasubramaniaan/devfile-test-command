# Devfile TSX Command Demo

This repository is a small, clean playground to demonstrate **all practical command patterns supported by Devfile (`devfile.yaml`)** using a simple TypeScript/TSX application.

It is designed to test and showcase:

- How multiline commands are handled
- How logical commands are auto-chained with `&&`
- How shell syntax is preserved
- How composite commands work (sequential, parallel, nested)
